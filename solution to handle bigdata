Q2.Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data. 
A2. There are two possible solutions to handle the big data,these are scale up and scale out.
1. scale up: 1.It increase the configuration of single file system like disk capacity,RAM, speed and data transfer,etc.
             2.but it is costly,complex and time consuming process.
             3.it is a monolithic system.
   scale out: 1.use multiple commodity machines and distribute the load among these machines.
              3. quickly implements its solution among its machines.
              4. it is not monolithic system instead increases its number of machines.
